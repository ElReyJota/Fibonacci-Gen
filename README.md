# Overview

Short project that I worked on in order to achieve some basic knowledge on the limits of the Rust programming language. The project completely uses and runs on Rust and doesn't use any external libraries. This software generates either a Fibonacci sequence or a Lucas sequence and displays it to the user.

# Development Environment

- Rust 1.78.0
- Visual Studio Code 1.89

# Useful Websites

- [Tutorials Point Rust Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rust/index.htm)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)

# Future Work

- Expand the program to generate more different mathematic sequences
- Make the program so you can generate multiple sequences on the same run
- Give it a prettier user interface
